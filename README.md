>**Description**

>In this phase I made a refactore for the code that given to me, so I made all the states inside the context provider and passed all it in the app to Todo component and from Todo component I passed it to all list form.
>
>**Describe how global state is consumed by the components**
>
>By using -> useContext() , by using it that allow to us to can share the data from all levels of our application, also by using it we can solve prop-drilling problem.
So to use useContext we can create a provider and put inside this provider all the props that I want to share it with all children, then the consumer can use all props when called it.

>**Describe the operation of the hook: useForm()**
>
>The useForm hook is designed for form management. It includes action methods for creating, editing, and duplicating forms.
useForm() hook takes different method than other hooks in  React ecosystem by adopting the use of unmanaged inputs using ref instead of depending on the state to manage the inputs. using the useForm() hook very usefull and it makes the forms reduces the number of re-renders.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
